                  Love programming. Mostly interested in Web development and 2D game programming but i also find plain old console programming quite fascinating.<br>
                  Appriciete hardwork and like to think of myself as a hardworker. <br>
                  An overthinker sometimes. Dont like parties and loud music. Would rewatch game of thrones on the couch rather than go out on weekends. Proud geek. <br>
                  Currently learning the guitar. Halfway through. Will learn Ukelele after that.<br>
                  Like learning. Growing.
